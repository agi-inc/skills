# ðŸª„ AI Skills Hub

AI Skills Hub is an open-source library aiming to simplify the integration of AI Skills into MULTION AI.

It provides utility functions to get a list of active skills from [agihub.io](https://agihub.io/) directory, get skill manifests, and extract OpenAPI specifications and load skills.

## Installation

You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install multion-skills
```

## Quick Start Example

**Load and Call Step by Step:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/edreisMD/plugnplai/blob/main/examples/plugins_step_by_step.ipynb)

**Generate Prompt with Plugins Description:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/edreisMD/plugnplai/blob/main/examples/create_prompt_plugins.ipynb)

**Plugins Retrieval:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/edreisMD/plugnplai/blob/main/examples/plugin_retriever_with_langchain_agent.ipynb)


## Usage

### Get a list of plugins

- `urls = get_plugins()`: Get a list of available plugins from a [plugins repository](https://www.plugplai.com/).

- `urls = get_plugins(filter = 'ChatGPT', category='dev')`: Use 'filter' or 'category' variables to query specific plugins

Example:

```python
import multion as ai

# Get all plugins from agihub.io
urls = ai.get_skills()

#  Get ChatGPT plugins - only ChatGPT verified plugins
urls = ai.get_skills(filter = 'ChatGPT')

#  Get working plugins - only tested plugins (in progress)
urls = ai.get_skills(filter = 'working')

#  Get plugins by category - only tested plugins (in progress)
urls = ai.get_skills(category = 'travel')

#  Get the names list of categories
urls = ai.get_category_names()
```

### Utility Functions

Help to load the plugins manifest and OpenAPI specification

- `manifest = get_skills_manifest(url)`: Get the AI Skill manifest from the specified skill URL.
- `specUrl = get_openapi_url(url, manifest)`: Get the OpenAPI URL from the skill manifest.
- `spec = get_openapi_spec(openapi_url)`: Get the OpenAPI specification from the specified OpenAPI URL.
- `manifest, spec = spec_from_url(url)`: Returns the Manifest and OpenAPI specification from the skill URL.

Example:

```python
import multion as ai

# Get the Manifest and the OpenAPI specification from the plugin URL
manifest, openapi_spec = ai.spec_from_url(urls[0])
```


### Load Skills
**Example:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/edreisMD/plugnplai/blob/main/examples/plugins_step_by_step.ipynb)

```python
from multion import Skills


# Initialize 'Skills' by passing a list of urls, this function will
# load the skills and build a default description to be used as prefix prompt
skilla = Skills.install_and_activate(urls)

#  Print the deafult prompt for the activated plugins
print(skills.prompt)

#  Print the number of tokens of the prefix prompt
print(skills.tokens)
```

Example on installing (loading) all plugins, and activating a few later:

```python
from multion import Skills

# If you just want to load the plugins, but activate only
# some of them later use Skills(urls) instead
skills = Skills(urls)

# Print the names of installed plugins
print(skills.list_installed)

# Activate the plugins you want
skills.activate(name1)
skills.activate(name2)
skills.activate(name3)

# Deactivate the last plugin
skills.deactivate(name3)
```

### Prompt and Tokens Counting

The `skills.prompt` attribute contains a prompt with descriptions of the active plugins.
The `skills.tokens` attribute contains the number of tokens in the prompt.

For example:
```python
skills = Skills.install_and_activate(urls)
print(skills.prompt)
print(skills.tokens)
```
This will print the prompt with skills descriptions and the number of tokens.


### Parse LLM Response for API Tag

The `parse_llm_response()` function parses an LLM response searching for API calls. It looks for the `<API>` pattern defined in the `skills.prompt` and extracts the skills name, operation ID, and parameters.


### Call API

The `call_api()` function calls an operation in an active skill. It takes the skills name, operation ID, and parameters extracted by `parse_llm_response()` and makes a request to the skills API.


### Apply Plugins

The `@skills.apply_skills` decorator can be used to easily apply active plugins to an LLM function. To use it:

1. Import the Plugins class and decorator:

```python
from multion import Skills, skills.apply_skills
```

2. Define your LLM function, that necessarily takes a string (the user input) as the first argument and returns a string (the response):

```python
@plugins.apply_skills
def call_llm(user_input):
  ...
  return response
```

3. The decorator will handle the following:

- Prepending the prompt (with plugin descriptions) to the user input 
- Checking the LLM response for API calls (the <API>...</API> pattern)
- Calling the specified skills 
- Summarizing the API calls in the LLM response
- Calling the LLM function again with the summary to get a final response

4. If no API calls are detected, the original LLM response is returned.

### Skills Retrieval
**Example:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/edreisMD/plugnplai/blob/main/examples/plugin_retriever_with_langchain_agent.ipynb)


```python
from multion import SkillRetriever

# Initialize the skill retriever vector database and index the skill descriptions.
# Loading the skills from agihub.io directory
skill_retriever = SkillRetriever.from_directory()

#  Retrieve the names of the skills given a user's message
skill_retriever.retrieve_names("what shirts can i buy?")
```
